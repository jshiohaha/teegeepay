### Send crypto confidentially in Telegram, on Solana.

![cover](./assets/images/cover.png)

## What is it?

A Telegram mini app enabling confidential transfers over Telegram, built on SPL Token‑2022's confidential transfers extension. This project was started for the [2026 Solana Privacy Hackathon](https://solana.com/privacyhack) and demonstrates the power of confidential transfers through every crypto user's favorite chat app: Telegram.

## Features

- No complex jargon, no infinite transaction signing experiences, zero friction to get started
- Use the features of Token2022 confidential transfers: deposit, withdraw, transfer
- Enable frictionless confidential transfers on Telegram via a Solana address or Telegram handle
- Quickly check public and private balances and compare against explorer data
- Backend-managed wallets associated with Telegram handles

## Architecture

The Next.js UI serves as a Telegram mini app that communicates with the Rust API backend. The API manages wallet keypairs, builds and executes Solana transactions using SPL Token-2022 with confidential transfer extensions.

**Important Security Note**: Since Telegram doesn't have an embedded wallet, this implementation stores user keypairs on the backend (non-custodial wallets managed server-side). This is **NOT** a secure production implementation and is intended for hackathon/demonstration purposes only.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- **Rust** with Axum web framework
- **SQLx** for database operations
- **Tokio** async runtime
- **Solana 3.0** crates, **spl-token-client** for Token2022 operations
- **PostgreSQL** for data persistence

### Frontend

- Next.js
- Telegram Mini App

### Solana

- SPL Token-2022 with confidential transfer extensions
- Surfpool for local testing
- Helius RPC (surfpool syncing on localnet, main RPC on mainnet)
- No custom smart contracts required

## Minimum Requirements

- Node.js 20
- Rust 1.92
- Solana CLI 2.3
- Docker and Docker Compose
- pnpm
- Solana cluster with confidential transfers enabled (right now, that is a local surfpool instance)

## Project Structure

├── crates
│   └── api              # Rust API backend
│       ├── src          # API source code

└── scripts              # Utility scripts
```

## Setup

### 1. Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and configure the variables in `.env` as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Required Environment Variables:**

- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot API token
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT authentication
- `AUTHORITY_KP`: Base58-encoded authority keypair for mint operations
- `AUDITOR_KP`: Base58-encoded auditor keypair for confidential transfers
- `RPC_URL`: Solana RPC endpoint with confidential transfer support

Set `DEV_MODE=true` when testing locally.

### 2. UI Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and the variables in `.env` as needed:

```bash
cp ui/.env.example ui/.env
```

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE=true` when testing locally.

### 3. Solana Network

Ensure you have a Solana cluster running with confidential transfer support. For local development, use Surfpool. For the hackathon development, I built surfpool from source on [this](https://github.com/txtx/surfpool/tree/zk-edge) branch.

```bash
./target/release/surfpool start
```

Once re-deployed to devnet/mainnet, you can use those clustes.

## Development

### Start the Backend API

The API runs in Docker with PostgreSQL:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will:

- Start PostgreSQL database
- Run database migrations
- Start the Rust API on port 6767

### Start the Frontend

In a separate terminal:

```bash
cd ui
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

The UI will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Utility Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains helpful utilities mostly for local setup/testing.

- `api-local.sh` - Run the API outside of Docker for development. You will need to specify a running PostgreSQL instance and Solana cluster.
- `create-mint.sh` - Create a new token mint with confidential transfers
- `reset-network.sh` - Reset the Surfpool network state
- `run-migrations.sh` - Manually run database migrations
- `db-up.sh` - Start only the database container
- `container-down.sh` - Stop all containers

## Important Notes

- This implementation is for **hackathon/demonstration purposes only**
- Wallets are stored on the backend, which is **not secure** for production
- Requires a Solana cluster with SPL Token-2022 and confidential transfer support
- For production use, implement proper key management and custody solutions
